Coding challenge for a job at RideCell :


Problem 1: Anagrams

Given a string of alphabetic characters, find an anagram that consists of the most space delimited words and an anagram that consists of exactly two space delimited words (if one exists). Valid words are defined as the words in the attached wordlist, and "anagram" as the result of rearranging the letters of a word to produce a new phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. Valid anagrams can contain single character words, but should not consist entirely of single character words. If no anagrams exist with two or more words, the program should print an empty string for both cases.


The result cannot be made up of only single character words, it can contain one single character words.



Example:
For the input word "incredible", the program might produce "bile cinder" as an anagram with just two words, and "ce be dirl in" is one with the maximum of four words.


Problem 2: Tail

Write a clone of the tail program available in unix/linux systems but only support a very small subset of the flags/options/features it supports. Pick and choose the complexity/scope based on the time you have and the options you like to support. Support at least the basic functionality you get with no options.


Please add instructions and any libraries we have to use to get things working. Development environments are available for the engineers to test your solutions.



If any of the above is vague or unclear, please let me know.
